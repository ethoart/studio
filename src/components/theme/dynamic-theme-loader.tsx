// This file is intentionally left blank as it will be deleted.
// The build system will handle the deletion based on the instruction to remove it.
// If an empty file causes issues, this CDATA block can be removed entirely
// if the system supports explicit file deletion commands.
// For now, making it empty ensures it doesn't contribute to the build if not deleted immediately.
